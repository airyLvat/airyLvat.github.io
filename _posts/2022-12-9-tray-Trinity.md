title: tray - How do I defend the Trinity?
author: Kingsley
---

The Christian doctrine of the Trinity defines **one God** existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons all sharing one essence. The Trinity is something that many Christians have misconceptions or misunderstandings about and a subject that non-Christians like to attack or use as a reason to dismiss Christianity. There **is no perfect analogy** for the Trinity and the most mature Christians will freely admit that it's a challenging concept that they may still grapple with. This post will cover why the Trinity is so hard to understand, why Christianity is still monotheistic even with a Triune God, the persons of the Trinity, and then how to answer common questions about it.

## Why it's so hard to understand the Trinity. Why there are no perfect analogies. Why it doesn't matter.

Before diving into the topic of the Trinity, it's important to understand *why* it's so hard to understand the Trinity.

You reading this and me writing this both exist in "the same mode". We are created, finite, limited beings. We experience time one second after another, we exist materially (physically) and we were made *in the image* of God. God, however, as the infinite, eternal, uncreated, perfect, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, creator and sustainer of time and the universe is an immaterial being. The existence that you and I experience is an entirely different mode than the existence of God. There is nothing in material existence that offers a perfect analogy to the existence of our Triune God. People like to come up with all kinds of worldly analogies (water in different states, different parts of an apple, one man wearing different hats, etc.) but those are all imperfect and wrong in different ways (perhaps a post on common Trinity misconceptions will come eventually). It's so hard to understand the Trinity (and therefore hard to defend, understand and why people like to attack it) because we can't relate to it. There's nothing that any human has ever experienced that's like God's existence.

**But that's okay.** We aren't called to understand God's perfect nature. We're called to obey and love him, to walk the path he lays before us dutifully and repent for when we inevitably all fall short. It's okay not to have a perfect grasp on the Trinity, because it's not necessary for us to have one.

> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
[Isaiah 55:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.55.8.ESV)

> He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?
[Micah 6:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/MIC.6.8.ESV)

Part of obeying God is believing the Bible. When the Bible says that the Father is God, that's true. When the Bible says that Jesus is God, that's true too. When the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is God, you guessed it - also true. When the Bible says that there is only one God, it's telling the truth. We don't need to understand why or how something is true for it to be true. The Bible, as God's word, tells us who God is. So, let's examine what scripture says about these matters.

## Is the Father God?

Most people don't debate who the Father is. It's very, very clear in both the New Testament and the Old Testament that God the Father is God. It's trivial to defend that point. What you might have to understand, though, is that the Father is not the Son. Luckily, we have scripture to make that clear.

> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
[Matthew 3:16-17](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.3.16-17.ESV)

This scripture makes it clear, in no uncertain terms, that God the Father and God the Son are *distinct* beings. God the Father is widely accepted as God **and he is a distinct person from God the Son**. The Father, who is speaking, talks about the Son as though he is a different person. This is a relational interaction between the two persons.

## Is Jesus (the Son) God?

Jesus is the Son of God, who is God. This is the point that most people will argue about even though there is overwhelming scriptural support for. Let's spend a little time here and really prove this point.

Consider this passage from Colossians 2.

> See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
[Colossians 2:8-9](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/COL.2.8-9.ESV)

Verse 8 might make us ask what evil would ever seek to lead us away from the truth of Christ? So, what *is* the truth of Christ? Luckily, verse 9 answers immediately: that the whole fullness of deity dwells in his body. Scripture makes it clear that this is the truth of Christ and we must not let anyone lead us away from it. He's divine not in the sense of pagan deity, but in the Jewish monotheistic sense.

Sometimes people say Jesus is "100% human and 100%" divine. The problem with that is it's a logical fallacy that Jesus could be 200% something. We also can't say that he's 50% divine and 50% human because that's simply incorrect. What we should say instead is that he is **truly** God and **truly** man. It's genuine when we say what Jesus is.

Here's a passage from Titus 2 that clearly identifies Jesus as God.

> waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
[Titus 2:13](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/TIT.2.13.ESV)

Some people try to twist this scripture to say that it talks about two subjects: "our great God" and separately "our Savior Jesus Christ". There is, however, a language rule in Greek that invalidates this argument called [Granville Sharp's rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnh_gFv1zFc&t=0s). When you put language together, there are certain rules and they can be applied consistently. You can watch the linked video to dive more deeply into this specific language rule, but what it *means* is that "God" and "Savior" are **absolutely both being applied to Jesus**. There's no grey area, no room for misinterpretation, no exceptions to this grammatical rule. The argument that this scripture from Titus is referring to two subjects is invalid. Therefore, Jesus is God.

The same grammatical rule is applied elsewhere in scripture, like in this excerpt from 2 Peter 1. Scripture is consistent on this matter: Jesus is God.

> Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
[2 Peter 1:1](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/2PE.1.1.ESV)

### Why doesn't Jesus ever say "I am God"?

But why doesn't Jesus ever say that he's God? Well, firstly, that's not a valid argument. I don't have to tell you something about myself for it to be true. Whether or not I tell you that I'm short doesn't change the fact that I'm short. However, this argument is moot anyway because Jesus actually does proclaim his divinity.

> Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am."
[John 8:58](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.8.58.ESV)

Jesus is implying here that he's greater than Abraham which is the kind of thing they might have killed you for in his time. The language here initially looks weird. "I am"? That's the wrong tense, isn't it? Shouldn't it say "I was?", like "Before Abraham was, I was"? But this is Jesus saying he is something *more*. This means he was not only preexistent before Abraham, but he is eternal. He simply *is*. Even better than that, Jesus is quoting YHWH (God) in the Old Testament (excerpt from Isaiah 43, emphasis added) when he declares that he is the "I am". This is a clear statement of deity.

> "You are my witnesses," declares the Lord, "and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that **I am** he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.
[Isaiah 43:10](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.43.10.ESV)

Jesus does this again, recorded in John 13:

> I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.
[John 13:19](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.13.19)

This was not lost on his Jewish audience. After Jesus proclaimed his divinity, a mob went to stone him, but he evaded them.

> So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.
[John 8:59](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.8.59.ESV)

When he made this statement in this context, the Jewish people knew this was a proclamation of his deity. This meant either that he was YHWH in the flesh or he was a blasphemer and they were going to come after him. He is either God, or making insane claims that are utterly untrue. Jesus certainly *did* proclaim his divinity, contrary to what some people would have you believe.

In case that's not clear enough, Jesus has this to say to the author of Revelation. Check the rest of the chapter for context to confirm that it is Jesus speaking (or just take my word for it).

> "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay each one for what he has done. **I am the Alpha and the Omega**, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
[Revelation 22:12-13](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/REV.22.12-13.ESV)

Consider this, also from Revelation, where the speaker is simply identified as God and not specifically as Jesus.

> "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
[Revelation 1:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/REV.1.8.ESV)

He is the Alpha and the Omega. He is the beginning and the end because he grounding of reality, because he is exalted above all things. It does not get more clear than that. This is a claim to deity.

So, Jesus certainly proclaims his divinity. Let's look at a little more scriptural evidence that he is correct in saying this.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[John 1:1](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.1.ESV)

Three simple statements:

* He was the Word
* The Word was with God
* The Word was God

He existed, had a relationship with God, and he was God. By the way, "the Word", indeed, does refer to Jesus.

> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[John 1:14](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.14.ESV)

Let's look at the verses that proceed John 1:1.

> He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
[John 1:2-3](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.2-3.ESV)

"In the beginning" is the creation event when God created the heavens and the earth. So all created things were made through God, Jesus existed before creation, therefore Jesus is uncreated. Since Jesus was also "with" God, there was a relationship between Jesus and the other persons of God (the Father and Holy Spirit). The only way the Word can be God *and be with* God at the same time is the Trinity.

There are a lot more examples from scripture that teach who Jesus is and confirm that he is God, but we have more to cover.

## Is the Holy Spirit God?

God the Holy Spirit is God. He is a distinct person who is God and not simply an angel or lesser spirit sent on behalf of God.

First, consider this scripture from Acts 5.

> But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God."
[Acts 5:3-4](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.5.3-4.ESV)

The context here is that Ananias had committed to selling some property and giving the proceeds, but instead kept some of it for himself. The important elements to identify for the purposes of this post, though, are that Peter identifies that Ananias lied to the Holy Spirit, and then two verses later confirms that Ananias lied *to God*. To lie to the Holy Spirit is to lie to God.

The more common debate on the Holy Spirit is whether or not he is *personal*. Is the Holy Spirit a person? Let's look at more scripture.

> While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
[Acts 13:2](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.13.2.ESV)

In this passage, the Holy Spirit is speaking and if you weren't asking the question "is he a person?" there'd be no question that he is. The Holy Spirit behaves personally at other times, as well.

> And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you. [Acts 10:19](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ACT.10.19.ESV)

The Holy Spirit speaks as though he is God and as though he has personhood. The Holy Spirit does several things including guiding, testifying, disclosing, glorifies Christ, and more things that only a person can do. These are not things that random forces do. He can also be blasphemed. You can't blaspheme electricity or gravity or some other natural force - only someone personal.

> but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"
[Mark 3:29](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/MRK.3.29.ESV)

The Holy Spirit is as much a person as Jesus. But is he God? Consider these words of Jesus, who we have already determined is God.

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[Matthew 28:19](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.28.19.ESV)

To baptize in the *singular* name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit indicates that while they are three, they are one.

## Is Christianity monotheistic (believing in one God)?

How can God be Triune and Christianity not be polytheistic (believing in multiple gods)? Let's examine scripture.

> "You are my witnesses," declares the Lord , "and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.
[Isaiah 43:10](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.43.10.ESV)

There was no god before nor will there be any after God. He is an eternal, unique, single being. This is monotheism.

> Thus says the Lord , the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god.
[Isaiah 44:6](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.44.6.ESV)

Besides God, there is no god. Only one God. Monotheism.

> Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together! Who told this long ago? Who declared it of old? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no other god besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides me.
[Isaiah 45:21](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.45.21.ESV)

These verses from Isaiah demonstrate, overwhelmingly, that there is one God. God is a Triune being of three persons, described earlier.

## Common questions, answered.

* **Q: Why isn't the word "Trinity" found in the Bible?**
  * A: The word "Trinity" isn't found in the Bible, but the concept is clearly taught. The word comes from the concept. We learned the concept and gave it a name. Do you believe God is omniscient? Of course, he's God. But the word "omniscient" isn't in the Bible either. It's a taught concept that we've given a name to.
* **Q: In John 17:3, Jesus says that God is the only true God.**
  * A: We believe that the Father is the only true God and so is Jesus and so is the Holy Spirit. Recall John 1:1 that says the Word is God and John 8:58 where Jesus says "I am".
* **Q: Jesus isn't God because he says "the Father is greater than I" in John 14:28.**
  * A: The context is that Jesus is in his earthly body and saying that it's a good thing that he is going to the Father. It's person-specific sense of greatness. He doesn't say that "God" is greater than me, but "the Father". Persons being greater than each other is different than God being greater. Also in John 17:5, he says "now Father glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed." This is because Jesus had laid aside his glory to become man. He's still God, but when he took on flesh he's bodily and therefore humbled and lowly. He's looking forward to the glorification when he returns to the Father. In Philippians 2:6-7, Jesus says that equality with God is not a thing to be grasped but he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant.
* **Q: Was God praying to God when Jesus prayed?**
  * A: When you have three persons in one being, you can understandably have communication between those three persons without them being separate beings. The members of the Trinity can communicate with each other because they are distinct.
* **Q: How can Jesus be God if he is God's Son?**
  * A: He is God's Son in the sense of *person*. This does not mean that he is not God in the sense of *being*.
* **Colossians says that Jesus is the first creation of God. How can he be created if he is God? (Colossians 1:15)**
  * It doesn't say he's created. Let's check the scripture. It says he's the image of God. He's God in human form. He's the firstborn of all creation because he's in charge of all creation. Firstborn doesn't mean that he's the first one born. It's a reference to his **rank**, that he is the "highest" or "King of Kings", aka God. Keep reading Colossians and it's obvious.

> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[Colossians 1:15](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/COL.1.15.ESV)

> For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
[Colossians 1:16-17](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/COL.1.16-17.ESV)

* **Q: Why didn't Jesus say "I am God"?**
  * A: He did. Scroll up!
