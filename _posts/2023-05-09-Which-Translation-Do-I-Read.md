title: Which Bible Translation Should I Read?

We are blessed to enjoy a large number of English Bible translations that are all reputable and worthwhile. While having such a wide variety of choices is, indeed, a huge blessing, it can also be confusing for people to navigate these waters and choose the right translation for them.

## The right translation is the one you read

I've got opinions on which Bible translations are better than others which I'm about to share. But it's critically important to keep in mind that the best Bible translation is the one that you read and that helps you grow closer to and build your personal relationship with God. As long as you're reading a reputable translation, there's not really a "wrong" choice.

## How to think about different Bible translations

Bible translations are generally classified by how "literal" they are versus how "dynamic" they are.

### Word for word translations (literal translations)

Bible translations are normally graded along a spectrum where on one end is "word for word" translations and on the other is "thought for thought" translations. Word for word translations strive to be as faithful as possible to the underlying original manuscripts that are written in Greek and Hebrew. They can be a little tougher to read, but are sometimes considered "more accurate". Popular word for word translations include NASB and ESV.

### Thought for thought translations (dynamic translations)

Thought for thought translations aim to be more readable by translating the idea behind a portion of scripture in a less exact way but that accurately represents the meaning of the scripture. Popular thought for thought translations include NIV and NLT.

### Comparing literal and dynamic translations

Consider the two following examples: John 1:1-3 ESV John 1:1-3 NLT.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.

[John 1:1-3 ESV](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JHN.1.1-3)

> In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him.

[John 1:1-3 NLT](https://my.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.1.1-3)

The first is more of a "word for word" and the second is more of a "thought for thought". You can see that they are similar in meaning but different in execution.

## Objectively poor choices

There's a third category of translation to avoid completely and those are "paraphrases". These take the "thought for thought" paradigm to the extreme to the point that they don't accurately represent the original Greek and Hebrew written by the author. The Message translation and The Passion translation are two examples of paraphrases.

There's also outright heretical manipulated translations like the NWT produced by the Jehovah's Witnesses that intentionally corrupts the text to provide support for their specific doctrines. Obviously these are also to be avoided.

## My recommendation

Depending on your reading level, I personally prefer the ESV (English Standard Version). If you're looking for an easier reading translation, I personally recommend NLT (New Living Translation). This becomes super subjective very quickly. Other reputable translations include NASB, KJV, NKJV, CSB, NIV, AMP and a handful of others.

Some people feel very strongly that only their preferred translation is valid, but that begins to enter a much deeper topic called textual criticism, and also general translative theory. It's a much bigger debate. But for a first time Bible reader who's just getting started, you have a lot of great options to choose from.
