title: Am I bothering God by praying too much?
author: Kingsley

To clear up one’s confusion about whether one can bother God with too much prayer, we have to understand two things: how God views prayer, and His All-Powerful, eternal nature.

## How does God view prayer?

Prayer is direct communication with God. Whenever Scripture mentions prayer, it never gives a limit to how much we should pray, it instead says the opposite. The Apostle Paul says to "pray without ceasing" and "in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God" (1 Thessalonians 5:17 and Philippians 4:6 respectively). God wants us to pray, He wants us to pray continually, consistently, and without ceasing.

> pray without ceasing,
[1 Thessalonians 5:17](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/1TH.5.17)

> do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
[Philippians 4:6](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/PHP.4.6)

Do not think of prayer as an employee bringing news to their boss, but think of prayer as a child communicating to their father. Just as a father loves to spend time with their child, and enjoys the exchanges, our Father in Heaven enjoys when we come to Him in prayer.

## God’s All-Powerful, Eternal Nature

You may have read many times in Scripture where it is said that God is eternal and that He is All-Powerful, but what does that mean?

Genesis 1:1 states that God created the heavens and the earth in the beginning (of time). A normal question in response would be, "What existed before the beginning?" The answer is a simple one: God. The entirety of the universe, the laws, concepts, and systems governing it, and those that dwell within it, were all created by God. Matter, space, and time are all things that exist within the universe and were created by God. Now if God created time, that supposes that He exists outside the boundaries of time. Therefore, He has no beginning and no end, He just is.

> In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[Genesis 1:1](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.1.1)

Jeremiah 32:17 states that God made the heavens and the earth with His great power, and that "there is nothing too hard for You". God has the power to accomplish anything. It’s not a matter of whether it’s even difficult or easy, but done or not done. To assume a task can be difficult/easy, there’s the possibility that the task can not be completed. That does not apply to God.

> ‘Ah, Lord God! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you.
[Jeremiah 32:17](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/JER.32.17)

Where am I going with all this? God is so powerful, and exists outside of time, that "too much prayer" is not a possibility. God has no beginning or end, and He knew what you will ask Him tomorrow since the creation of the earth. He is so powerful that there is no amount of prayer that will overwhelm Him. This is the God that we serve, and it is a blessing to serve a God who enjoys our time through prayer.
