Something fascinating to consider regarding the resurrection of Jesus and his burial.

## How Jesus' body was prepared

Mary's brother was buried with 10 to 15 lb of myrrh, Jesus was buried with either 75 lbs or 150 lbs (most scholars go with 150 lb cuz it was written in one of the Gospels). The preparing of the body included wetting the myrrh and sticking it between the bindings and letting it dry and harden like a cast. Mary's brother had to be helped to untie the bindings with only 10 to 15 lbs of myrrh.

## What that means

So, Jesus would have been encased in 150 lbs cast that really couldn't have been cut open. And somebody would have noticed a stiff man being carried by four people because were now we're talking a 300 lbs body across the valley. It is simply unfeasible that his body was taken. Plus, it was under guard and even if you ignore the guards the road to the city was right there. The casting with murder is a strong proof that the resurrection happened exactly how the Gospels say. Also, there were no shreddings from the casting only a neatly folded napkin.
