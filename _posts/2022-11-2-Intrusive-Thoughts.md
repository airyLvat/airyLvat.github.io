title: Intrusive Thoughts
---

People of all ages and backgrounds may be plagued by intrusive thoughts. Here are some biblically supported ideas on them.

## God knows our thoughts

God knows all of our thoughts, he is not surprised by any of them whether they are intentional or not. He also knows that our minds are often weak (Psalm 94:11). If we have a wicked thought, we know that God is always prepared to forgive (Isaiah 55:7). Additionally, God is aware of the difference between the convictions of a wicked heart and a fleeting thought of someone who loves him.

> the Lord â€”knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
[Psalm 94:11](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.94.11)

> let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord , that he may have compassion on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
[Isaiah 55:7](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.55.7)

## Submit to God

We are encouraged to submit our hearts and thoughts to God (Psalm 139:23-24). For truly spontaneous thoughts, 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 explains what to do - by studying scripture and reaffirming the truth in our minds, we can eliminate intrusive thoughts (also Psalm 94:19).

> Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!
[Psalm 139:23-24](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.139.23-24)

> For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ,
[2 Corinthians 10:3-5](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/2CO.10.3-5)

> When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
[Psalm 94:19](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/PSA.94.19)

## Are thoughts sinful?

Intrusive thoughts are not necessarily sinful, even if they are blasphemous. Our minds are weak and we are easily influenced by society and the world. If we intentionally expose ourselves to blasphemy and other evil, we may, however, be sinning. The more we fill ourselves with worldly things, the more the world will invade our thoughts. Romans 12:2 instructs us not to submit to the ways of the world, but rather be filled with wisdom by God. Philippians 4:8 shows us we must focus on what's honorable and true.

> Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[Romans 12:2](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.12.2)
