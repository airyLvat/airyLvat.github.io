title: Why is Jesus' death an acceptable sacrifice for our sins?

The death of Jesus is the sacrifice by which Christians may be washed clean of their sins and be made righteous with God. Why is this acceptable? How can Jesus' death pay the debts of any and every random sinner who believes?

## God's justice is perfect

The ways of God are not our ways, his ways are higher (Isaiah 55:8). His works are faithful and perfect and just. The punishment for sin is death (Romans 6:23) and good works cannot make up for our sin against God. To bear the punishment for our sins would be to suffer in hell for eternity, instead he kept his promise to send and sacrifice the perfect lamb (Jesus) to bear the sins of those who trust in him. Jesus' death was acceptable because he is the only one capable of paying the penalty for our sins.

> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord .
[Isaiah 55:8](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ISA.55.8)

> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[Romans 6:23](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.6.23)

## Follow this logic

1. Mankind was created sinless
2. Mankind sinned
3. Sin separated men from the holy God
4. Because God is the source of life, separation from God brings about death
5. Hence, death is the consequence for sin
6. God is just, hence He does not act unjustly by waiving the penalty for sin: death
7. But God is also loving. He does not want to see mankind die.
8. So the solution that satisfies His justice and lovingkindness is to execute the penalty for sin, on someone else, namely Himself (we don't discuss Trinity yet to simplify this explanation first)
9. Because of that, He became human, so that He can take on the penalty for humans: death
10. Once that penalty has been executed, justice has been satisfied. Humans who accept this substitution don't need to be punished anymore.
11. Sins of humans in point 10 have been resolved, so they can be with God again in heaven
12. Number 11 is basically going back to God's original design when He created mankind
