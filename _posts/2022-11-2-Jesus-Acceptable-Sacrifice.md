The death of Jesus is the sacrifice by which Christians may be washed clean of their sins and be made righteous with God. Why is this acceptable? How can Jesus' death pay the debts of any and every random sinner who believes?

## God's justice is perfect

The ways of God are not our ways, his ways are higher (Isaiah 55:8). His works are faithful and perfect and just. The punishment for sin is death (Romans 6:23) and good works cannot make up for our sin against God. To bear the punishment for our sins would be to suffer in hell for eternity, instead he kept his promise to send and sacrifice the perfect lamb (Jesus) to bear the sins of those who trust in him. Jesus' death was acceptable because he is the only one capable of paying the penalty for our sins.

> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord .

> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[Romans 6:23](https://my.bible.com/bible/59/ROM.6.23)
